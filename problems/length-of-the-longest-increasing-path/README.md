3288. Length of the Longest Increasing Path

You are given a 2D array of integers coordinates of length n and an integer k, where 0 <= k < n.

coordinates[i] = [xi, yi] indicates the point (xi, yi) in a 2D plane.

An increasing path of length m is defined as a list of points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), ..., (xm, ym) such that:

xi < xi + 1 and yi < yi + 1 for all i where 1 <= i < m.
(xi, yi) is in the given coordinates for all i where 1 <= i <= m.

Return the maximum length of an increasing path that contains coordinates[k].

 

Example 1:

Input: coordinates = [[3,1],[2,2],[4,1],[0,0],[5,3]], k = 1

Output: 3

Explanation:

(0, 0), (2, 2), (5, 3) is the longest increasing path that contains (2, 2).

Example 2:

Input: coordinates = [[2,1],[7,0],[5,6]], k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

(2, 1), (5, 6) is the longest increasing path that contains (5, 6).

 

Constraints:

1 <= n == coordinates.length <= 105
coordinates[i].length == 2
0 <= coordinates[i][0], coordinates[i][1] <= 109
All elements in coordinates are distinct.
0 <= k <= n - 1
